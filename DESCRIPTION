Title: Store Tables in SQL Database
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Magnus Thor Torfason
Maintainer: Magnus Thor Torfason <m@zulutime.net>
Description: Provides functions for quickly writing (and 
  reading back) a data.frame to file in 'SQLite' format. The name 
  stands for *Store Tables using 'SQLite'*, or alternatively for *Quick 
  Store Tables* (either way, it could be pronounced as *Quest*). 
  For data.frames containing the supported data 
  types it is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for the 
  'write_*()' and 'read_*()' functions provided by similar packages.
