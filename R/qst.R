#' Store Tables in SQL Database
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This package provides functions for quickly writing (and reading)
#' back a `data.frame` to file in `sqlite` format. The name stands
#' for *Store Tables using SQLite'*, or alternatively for *Quick
#' Store Tables* (either way, it could be pronounced as *Quest*).
#'
#' For `data.frames` containing the supported data
#' types it is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for the
#' `write_*()` and `read_*()` functions provided by packages such
#' as `fst`, `feather`, `qs`, and `readr` packages (as well as the
#' `writeRDS()` and `readRDS()` functions).
